# 0. Make sure you complete the other assignments in this folder first!

# 1. Find an image on the internet or use the provided image (big_eye_bird.png)
# and drop it into your sketch. It can be anything as long as it has large eyes!

    # 2. Import your image using the following code:
    #global face
    #face = loadImage("big_eye_bird.png")

    
    # 3. Set the size of your sketch and the size of your image to be
    # the same by entering the following code in the setup method.
    #size(800, 800)
    #face.resize(width, height)

    # 4. Draw your image using:
    #global face
    #background(face)

    # 5. Place a white circle over the left eye of your image.
    # *HINT* The current position of the mouse is printed to the
    # console. Use it to find the center of the left eye.
    # fill(<your color>)
    # circle(x, y, diameter)

    # 6. Call the draw_gooly_eye function with the correct input parameters to draw
    # the pupil insdie the eye. Does it stay inside the eye and follow the mouse?
    
    # 7. Repeat the steps above for the right eye and observe the googly eyes!
